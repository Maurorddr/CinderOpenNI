This is a very simple wrapper for OpenNI to use with Cinder, following on the philosophy of wrapping only things that need to be wrapped and allowing users to dig into the specifics of their library as much as possible. 

OSX is not yet fully supported by OpenNI

In the “Build Settings” tab, set the “Header Search Paths” as “/usr/include/ni”. To link with the library, open the Terminal and execute “open /usr/lib”. The Finder will open in the folder “/usr/lib”. Now drag the file “libOpenNI.dylib” to the folder “Frameworks” of your Xcode project. There is another way of adding Frameworks to projects, which is through the “Link Binary With Libraries” option of the “Build Phases” tab of the target of your project. The old “add existing frameworks” option of Xcode 3 disappeared.

Because XCode assumes that / is the same as /Developer/SDK/blah/blah I've added this SYSROOT = ../../../../../../../ and the LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS = "$(SYSROOT)usr/lib" to link to what you have installed rather than whatever is at the /Developer/SDK/blah/usr/lib



Win7 VC10 is fully supported. Win8 VC12 is not yet supported by OpenNI

In preferences -> “C/C++” tab, add C:\Program Files(x86)\OpenNI2\Include and optionally C:\Program Files(x86)\Primesense\NITE2\Include to the header include paths. You'll also want to add the same paths to the Linker paths, as well as adding the libraries themselves. You should also make sure that the the include path to ciOpenNI.h is there, for the simple fromOpenNI() and toOpenNI() methods. That's about all. Have fun!
